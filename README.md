# mvstk5
Gather and structure issues around MVS TK5, the OS/VS2 3.8 (MVS) distribution by Rob Prins.

This repository will not contain the code for the distribution but will be the official issue list.
The distribution can be downloaded on https://www.prince-webdesign.nl/tk5 
Collaborators can, however, use it to exchange examples and collaborate on code which is needed in the
resolution of issues.

It is envisaged that potential issues first will be discussed on [https://groups.io/g/turnkey-mvs](https://groups.io/g/turnkey-mvs) before being entered as an issue - this might help in getting the issue descriptions right and have greater visibility to answers to questions (but it is no hard rule - if you want to open an issue right away and have good supporintg material, be our guest). Rob will ultimately decide upon the closing of issues; the issue opener can assist in indicating whether a specific problem is solved or not, and report test results.
